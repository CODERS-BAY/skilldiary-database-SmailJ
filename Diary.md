## 26.08.2020 - Database


Today i learned the rough structure of a database, how relationships between tables are maintained, how they are named and correctly divided. Now i know what are the 9 CODD´schn Conditions and for what they stay. Some hours we practiced how to model a database. So i know what are entity´s, relationships & attributes. The cardinalities are 1:1, 1:N, N:1 and M:N. The datatypes are similar to the JAVA datatypes, there are a lot of them. 

The End for day one.
